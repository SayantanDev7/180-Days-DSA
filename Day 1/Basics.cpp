//According to Moorey Transistor capacity is getting doubled every 2 years.So to store large data we need to use binary numbers 

//Execution Time -> Machine Lang > Assembly Lang > High Level Lang

//Time complexity -> Time complexity is a way to represent the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
