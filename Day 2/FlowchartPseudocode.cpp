//Flowchart -> Systematic representation of the flow of algorithms

//Pseudocode -> Pseudocode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do, expressed in a formally-styled natural language rather than in a programming language.

//Flowchart and Pseudocode are used for planning and visualizing algorithms before actual coding.

//Example: Flowchart and Pseudocode for finding the maximum of two numbers
