/*
TC is the calculation of the time complexity of an algorithm, which measures how the runtime of the algorithm grows with the size of the input data.
SC is the calculation of the space complexity of an algorithm, which measures how the memory usage of

the algorithm grows with the size of the input data.
The time complexity is often expressed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's runtime.

The worst to best time complexity are :-
O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n^2) < O(2^n) < O(n!)
